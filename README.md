This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.



# Notes and todo type stuff.

Use HTTPS for secure communication: Make sure your application is using HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and the server. This will help protect the user's credentials during transmission.

Rate-limiting: Consider implementing rate-limiting to prevent brute force attacks on user accounts. This can be done using a middleware or an external package like "express-rate-limit" if you were using Express.js.

Separate concerns: While the code you provided is functional, it's generally a good practice to separate concerns by extracting the authentication logic into a separate module or function. This makes your code easier to maintain, test, and reuse.

Improve error handling: You could improve error handling by providing more specific error messages to the client. However, keep in mind that providing too much information might expose potential vulnerabilities. You should also handle any unexpected errors that might occur during the authentication process.

Use environment variables for secrets: If you are using any secret keys (e.g., for JWT), make sure to store them in environment variables rather than hardcoding them in your code. This adds an extra layer of security and makes it easier to manage your secrets.

Consider using an authentication library: There are existing libraries and frameworks that handle authentication for you, such as Passport.js or NextAuth.js. Using such libraries can simplify your code and provide additional security features out-of-the-box.

Store session data server-side: Storing the user ID in a session cookie can expose the user's internal database identifier to the client. Consider using a more secure method to store session data, such as signed cookies or server-side sessions.

Add HttpOnly and Secure flags to the cookie: To improve the security of your session cookie, set the httpOnly and secure flags. The httpOnly flag helps prevent XSS attacks by making the cookie inaccessible to JavaScript, and the secure flag ensures that the cookie is only sent over HTTPS.

javascript
Copy code
setCookie({ res }, 'authToken', user.id.toString(), {
  maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60,
  path: '/',
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
})
With these improvements in place, your authentication implementation will be more robust and secure.
